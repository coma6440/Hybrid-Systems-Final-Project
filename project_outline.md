## Introduction/Motivation
- Didn't have an applicable research to apply, wanted to explore implementation
- OMPL has implementation, but uses rectangular obstacles and velocity control
## Problem Setup
- Robot model
- Unicycle dynamics
- Environment definition (buffers)
## Background
- Delauney triangulation
- Product Graph (decomposition, co-safe, safe)
- Output-input feedback linearization
## Methodology
- Convex obstacle checking
- Solving for analytical motion model
- SPOT specification
## Results
- Automaton visualizations
- Number of propositions in triangular decomposition
- Visualize decompositions
- Visualize solution paths
- Benchmark results?
## Conclusion
