## Introduction/Motivation
- Didn't have an applicable research to apply, wanted to explore implementation
- OMPL has implementation, but uses rectangular obstacles and velocity control
## Problem Setup
- Robot model
- Unicycle dynamics
- Environment definition (buffers/point mass assumption)
## Background
- LTL specifications (cosafe vs safe)
- Delauney triangulation
- Product Graph (decomposition, co-safe, safe)
- Output-input feedback linearization
## Methodology
- Convex obstacle checking
- Solving for analytical motion model
- SPOT specification
## Results
- Automaton visualizations
- Number of propositions in triangular decomposition
- Visualize decompositions
- Visualize solution paths
- Solution statistics for 10? runs of each
## Conclusion
- Summary of results
- Lessons learned
- Future work
